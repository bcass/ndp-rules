another place is in order and may be decided by a majority vote.

1.4.2. **Amendments. **Amendments to any motion may be made orally, but before consideration thereof  
must be submitted in writing and must be germane to the propositions to which offered. Agreement to a  
motion to lay amendment on the table carries with it the proposition to which it is offered. Majority and  
minority reports from committees are subject to amendment from the floor unless the previous question is  
operating.

1.4.3. **Roll Call. **The roll call shall be called by Counties, and Districts within Counties, and the Chair  
of the County or District delegation shall take the poll and announce the vote.

1.4.4. **Challenges**

1.4.4.1 **From within Delegation. **On roll call by Counties and Districts within Counties, a delegation  
shall be polled on challenge by any member of the delegation. Demand for poll of delegation or challenge  
of accuracy of count must be made when vote is reported and comes too late after the next County, or  
District within a County, is called. Such demand may not be made by anyone not a member of the  
delegation and no delegate may request a poll of any other delegation than his/her own. The only method  
by which a poll of a delegation may be had is by challenging the accuracy of the count or report, but such  
challenge is in order on any vote regardless of the character. The poll of a delegation must include the  
entire delegation. A demand for a poll of a delegation may be withdrawn any time before the poll starts.  
The Chair of the Convention may defer a poll until the conclusion of a roll call. When a delegation is  
polled, the delegates in responding to their names are restricted to the bare announcement of their vote  
and explanations or comments of any character are out of order.

1.4.4.2 **From Floor. **Upon demand from the floor by any delegate, the Chair of the Convention shall call  
a roll of a delegation to determine the number of eligible delegates thereof present.

1.4.5. **Committee Reports. **When Committees are recognized to report, the Chair of the Committee  
may read the report himself or have it read by the reading clerk of the Convention. At the conclusion of  
the reading of the report, the Chair has fifteen \(15\) minutes in which he may \(1\) speak to the report, \(2\)  
yield time to others to speak, or \(3\) move the previous question. When committee reports are submitted,  
the question of agreeing to the report is considered as pending. Minority reports from committees must be  
presented and read immediately following majority reports, and both are then open to debate and  
amendment, unless the previous question is ordered. When more than one minority report is submitted, all  
are presented before consideration on the majority report begins, and are taken up in the order presented.  
The question comes first on minority reports and then on majority report or minority report as amended.

1.4.6. **Debate. **Recognition for debate is within the discretion of the Chair, but members of Committees  
reporting a proposition under discussion are entitled to the floor and take precedence over others desiring  
to be heard. A delegate desiring to interrupt a speaker shall address the Chair and secure the consent of  
the speaker. The Chair of a committee making the report may have fifteen \(15\) minutes to speak. All  
other debate shall be limited to five \(5\) minutes to each speaker. No delegate shall speak twice to the  
same question unless permission is granted by general consent, and then only if all others who wish to  
speak have been heard.

1.4.7. **Decorum. **Delegates and guests are expected to be seated and to refrain from loud conversation  
during session of the Convention. Aisles and platforms must be kept clear.

1.4.8. **Delegates. **A delegate announcing that he/she will not abide by the decision of the Convention is  
not entitled to participate in its deliberations. Delegates failing to observe Rules of the Convention are  
subject to expulsion by two- thirds \(2/3\) vote.

1.4.9. **Division. **A division of the question, and a separate vote on each substantive proposition  
contained in a committee report or any pending question, may be requested by any delegate, and is in  
order even after the previous question is demanded.

1.4.10. **Motions and Resolutions. **Delegates must secure recognition from the Chair in order to offer a  
motion, and the Chair may inquire for what purpose the delegate rises, and after hearing the motion, may  
decline recognition. After an order of business is adopted, no motions are admissible unless in order under  
the pending item of business or at that particular state of the proceedings.

1.4.11. **Points of Order. **Points of order against a proceeding are too late after debate has begun or other  
business has intervened. Debate on a question of order is within the discretion of the Chair. Points of  
Order arising during a roll call are decided peremptorily and are not subject to appeal.

1.4.12. **Previous Question. **The previous question when ordered precludes both debate and amendment.  
A Committeeperson presenting a report may move the previous question, but if ordered before any debate  
is had on the question, twenty \(20\) minutes of debate is allowed, ten \(10\) minutes for each side.

**Explanation:**When a member says, "I move the previous question," such motion is then considered to be  
the pending question, and the motion which was pending when the previous question was moved is  
considered to be the previous question.

1.4.13. **Recess. **A motion to recess is always in order, and not debatable.

1.4.14. **Reconsidered. **When a motion is carried or lost, any member of the majority may move  
reconsideration at the same session of the convention. This motion takes precedence over all motions  
except motion to adjourn.

1.4.15. **Suspension of Rules. **Motion to suspend the Rules interrupts the regular order of business and is  
in order at any time except during roll call, but recognition to move suspension is within the jurisdiction  
of the Chair and the motion requires a two-thirds \(2/3\) majority. The motion to suspend the Rules may not  
be amended, reconsidered or laid on the table.

1.4.16. **Table. **A motion to lay on the table is used to delay consideration of a motion or amendment. It  
is not debatable and may not be amended. Unless the motion to table specifies a time certain to resume  
consideration, a motion to remove it from the table must be made to continue such consideration. An  
amendment laid on the table carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was offered.

**Explanation:**A motion to lay on the table is out of order after a pending motion \(except an amendment\)  
which has been made and debated, is about to be put on a vote.

1.4.17. **Unanimous Consent. **Any action may be taken and any proceeding had by unanimous consent  
regardless of the Rules or pending order of business, but recognition of any motion to unanimously  
consent is within the discretion of the Chair and may not be granted except for routine matters and under  
exceptional circumstances.

1.4.18. **Who is Entitled to Speak. **No person who is not a delegate or an alternate who is taking the  
place of a delegate, shall be permitted to address the convention unless such person has been previously  
requested to do so by the Democratic State Central Committee or by a three-fourths \(3/4\) vote of the  
Convention. Unless otherwise fixed by the State Central Committee, all such speeches shall be limited to  
three \(3\) minutes.

1.4.19. **Definitions. **The terms “notification”, “provided in writing”, and “written” when occurring  
throughout the Constitution and/or Bylaws shall include digital and electronic means as well as paper-  
based means of communication, as long as it is transmitted to the recipient and not merely posted on a  
website or bulletin board.

1.4.20 **Absence of Rule. **In the absence of any rule governing a situation, Roberts Rules of Order shall  
govern the procedure of the Convention.

#### **1.5. Voting**.

1.5.1. **Qualifications to Vote. **No person shall be permitted to vote in any State Convention unless  
he/she has been duly elected and certified as a delegate; or, in the absence of such elected delegate, unless  
he/she has been elected as an alternate in the manner set forth in Article IV, Section 6.

1.5.2. **Each Delegate One Vote. **All delegates who are found to be duly qualified shall be entitled to  
one vote on any question coming before the State Convention.

1.5.3. **Proxy or Unit Rule. **No delegate or alternate shall be permitted to vote by proxy and no  
delegations shall apply to the Unit Rule.

1.5.4. **Method of Voting.**

1.5.4.1 **Roll Call: Announced by Delegation Chair. **On roll call of the Counties and Legislative  
Districts within Counties, the vote of the County or Legislative District shall be announced by the Chair  
of the County or Legislative District delegation, or in his/her absence, by the Vice Chair. Delegations not  
prepared to announce their vote may be passed and called at the end of roll call.

1.5.4.2 **Place of Casting Vote. **In order to vote, a delegate must sit with his/her delegation and may not  
vote from another part of the hall and may not deputize another to cast his/her vote for him/her.

1.5.4.3 **Change of Vote or Abstention. **A delegate may decline to vote or may change his/her vote at  
any time prior to the announcement of the final result. A delegate proposing to change his/her vote must  
rise in his/her place and personally request the change.

1.5.4.4 **Demand for Roll Call. **A roll call for yeas and nays must be ordered on demand of one-fourth  
\(1/4\) of the delegates present.

5.7.1**. Recognition and Qualification**. Affiliated Caucus Organizations \(ACOs\) shall be recognized to  
aid and assist the Nebraska Democratic Party in organizing a specific constituency for the benefit of the  
party and its candidates for elected office. An ACO must be an organized group of Nebraska Democrats  
with members from every Congressional District who support the NDP and its policies and objectives.  
Membership will include registered Democrats and may include persons who will register as Democrats  
upon becoming eligible to vote. Recognition of an ACO by the State Central Committee shall be  
dependent upon the quality and integrity of the ACO’s governing documents, the ACO’s effectiveness  
and the ACO’s strategic importance to the long-term growth and success of the Nebraska Democratic  
Party.

5.7.2. **Recognition Procedures**. Initial application for Recognition from a prospective ACO shall be  
referred to the Rules Committee to review. The Committee shall: review the prospect’s governing  
documents and meet with its leadership; ensure that the prospect provides a functional, democratic  
process for amending its documents, electing its officers, and achieving its purpose; and make a  
recommendation to the State Central Committee on whether to recognize the prospect as an NDP ACO.  
Recognition must be approved by a majority vote of the State Central Committee. Recognition of an ACO  
shall run concurrently with the biennial term of a State Central Committee.

5.7.3. **Responsibilities**. ACOs shall take no public position that is inconsistent with the NDP Platform  
and shall not publicly endorse a candidate who is not a registered Democrat in any election. Each ACO  
shall abide by state and federal election laws regarding political committees. Each ACO must agree to  
give its membership list \(including names and contact information\) to the State Party or contact its  
members on behalf of the State Party when requested. Each ACO must provide the State Party with its  
officers’ names and contact information.

5.7.4. **Representation**. Upon selection of an ACO’s duly authorized representative to the NDP, the  
elected leader of the ACO shall notify the State Chair of the name and contact information of that  
representative. Two absences from meetings of the State Executive Committee or State Central  
Committee during a biennial term by the designated representative or alternate will result in suspension of  
the ACO pending a Review by the State Rules Committee.

5.7.5. **Continued Recognition**. Recognition shall be automatically renewed for a new biennial term upon  
the ACO’s submission of its current organizational documents to the State Rules Committee and updated  
names and contact information of its officers to the State Chair by the first meeting of the State Central  
Committee. The organizational meeting of a new State Central Committee shall not be considered the  
“first meeting” for purposes of this rule. Failure to provide the appropriate data shall cause the ACO’s  
Recognition to be suspended pending a Review by the State Rules Committee.

5.7.6. **Review**. Recognition of an ACO may be reviewed by the State Rules Committee as provided in  
these Bylaws or at the request of the State Central Committee to determine whether an ACO meets all  
requirements of these Bylaws while complying with the ACO’s own organizational documents. The  
Rules Committee shall make a recommendation on Continuing Recognition of the ACO to the State  
Central Committee. Revocation of Recognition of an ACO must be approved by a majority vote of the  
State Central Committee.

5.8. **Officer Vacancies. **The State Central Committee shall fill vacancies in the offices of State Chair,  
the State Associate Chairs, and National Committee Members if such vacancies occur between  
Conventions. The methods to do so are:

5.8.1. **State Chair. **The First Associate Chair will assume the duties of the State Chair on a temporary  
basis until a new Chair is elected. Election of a new Chair shall occur at the first regular quarterly State  
Central Committee meeting after the vacancy occurs. Procedure for such election shall be determined by  
the State Central Committee.

5.8.2. **Associate Chairs and National Committee Members. **Election of any of these officers shall  
occur at the first regular quarterly State Central Committee meeting after the vacancy occurs. Procedure

### **8. RULES OF ORDER**

8.1. **NDP Committees, Organizations and Affiliates. **The Rules of Order in this Bylaw pertain to  
Meetings of any Committee, Organization or Affiliate \(each referred to as “Group”\) of the Nebraska  
Democratic Party unless a Group adopts a written set of Rules of Order for its conduct of business in  
meetings. These Rules of Order do not pertain to the State Convention \(See Bylaw 1\). In this Bylaw  
members of any such Group are referred to as “members” even though the Group’s members may have a  
different title.

8.2. **Motions and Resolutions. **Members must secure recognition from the Chair in order to offer a  
motion, and the Chair may inquire for what purpose the member rises, and after hearing the motion, may  
decline recognition. After an order of business is adopted, no motions are admissible unless in order under  
the pending item of business or at that particular state of the proceedings. Motions may be stated orally or  
in writing. Resolutions must be submitted in writing.

**Explanation**: Unless otherwise indicated, all actions discussed in this Bylaw take a majority to pass.

8.3. **Amendments. A**mendments to any motion may be made orally or in writing and must be  
germane to the propositions to which offered. Amendments to Resolutions must be in writing and  
germane to the Resolution being offered. Majority and minority reports from committees are subject to  
amendment from the floor unless the previous question is operating.

8.4. **Debate. **Recognition for debate is within the discretion of the Chair, but members of Committees  
reporting a proposition under discussion are entitled to the floor and take precedence over others desiring  
to be heard. A member desiring to interrupt a speaker shall address the Chair and secure the consent of the  
speaker. Debate is not in order during roll call vote while a call is pending. Debate may be limited at the  
discretion of the Chair; however, a simple motion to extend the debate is in order.

8.5. **Committee Reports. **When Committees are recognized to report, the Chair of the Committee  
may read the report himself or have it read by the Secretary. When committee reports are submitted, the  
question of agreeing to the report is considered as pending. Minority reports from committees must be  
presented and read immediately following majority reports, and both are then open to debate and  
amendment, unless the previous question is ordered. When more than one minority report is submitted, all  
are presented before consideration on the majority report begins, and are taken up in the order presented.  
The question comes first on minority reports and then on majority report or minority report as amended.

8.6. **Division. **A division of the question, and a separate vote on each substantive proposition  
contained in a committee report or any pending question, may be requested by any member, and is in  
order even after the previous question is demanded.

8.7. **Points of Order. **Points of order against a proceeding are too late after debate has begun or other  
business has intervened. Debate on a question of order is within the discretion of the Chair. Points of  
Order arising during a roll call are decided peremptorily and are not subject to appeal.

8.8. **Previous Question. **The previous question when ordered precludes both debate and amendment.  
The normal motion is “I move the previous question.” However, saying, “I call the question” or “I call for  
the question” should be taken as moving the previous question. The motion requires a second, is not  
debatable and cannot be amended. It requires a two-thirds \(2/3\) majority to pass. If passed the effect is to  
end debate and move to vote on the question being considered.

**Explanation:**When a member says, "I move the previous question," such motion is then considered to be  
the pending question, and the motion which was pending when the previous question was moved is  
considered to be the previous question.

8.9. **Reconsidered. **When a motion is carried or lost, any member of the majority may move  
reconsideration at the same meeting of the Group. This motion takes precedence over all motions except  
motion to adjourn.

8.10. **Delay or end consideration of a Question.**

8.10.1 **Table. **A motion to lay on the table is used to delay consideration of a motion or amendment. It  
is not debatable and may not be amended. Unless the motion to table specifies a time certain to resume  
consideration, a motion to remove it from the table must be made to continue such consideration. An  
amendment laid on the table carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was offered.

8.10.2. **Postpone. **A motion to postpone consideration is used when it is evident that more information is  
needed to enhance the debate of a question. A time certain to resume consideration should be included in  
such a motion. It is debatable and may be amended. A motion to postpone requires a simple majority to  
pass. An amendment postponed carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was offered.

8.10.3. **Postpone Indefinitely. **A motion to postpone indefinitely is used by a group to indicate that the  
group does not wish to take a position on the question. The motion is debatable but may not be amended.  
An amendment postponed indefinitely carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was  
offered.

8.11. **Recess. **A motion to recess is always in order, and not debatable.

8.12. **Motion to Adjourn. **A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn to meet at a designated time  
and/or date may be made at any time recognition is secured for that purpose, but is not in order during a  
roll call. A simple motion to adjourn is not debatable and may not be laid on the table. A motion to  
adjourn at a certain time is debatable and subject to amendment. A motion to adjourn to a day and/or time  
certain or to meet at another place is in order, is debatable and amendable. All motions to adjourn are  
decided by a majority vote.

8.13. **Decorum. **Members and guests are expected to be seated and to refrain from loud conversation  
during a meeting.

8.14. **Suspension of Rules. **A motion to suspend the Rules does not pertain to the Rules in this Bylaw  
but to any procedural rules adopted by a Group. The motion interrupts the regular order of business and is  
in order at any time except during roll call, but recognition to move suspension is within the jurisdiction  
of the Chair. The motion requires a two-thirds \(2/3\) majority. The motion to suspend the Rules may not  
be amended, reconsidered or laid on the table.

8.15. **Unanimous Consent. **Any action may be taken and any proceeding had by unanimous consent  
regardless of the Rules or pending order of business, but recognition of any motion to unanimously  
consent is within the discretion of the Chair and may not be granted except for routine matters and under  
exceptional circumstances.

8.16. **Who is Entitled to Speak. **A person who is not a member of a Group shall not be permitted to  
address the Group in any meeting unless such person is given permission to do so by the Chair or by  
unanimous consent of the members present.

8.17. **Electronic Meetings. **Unless specifically prohibited in governing documents, meetings may be  
convened or attended using electronic means such as teleconference or video conference, at the discretion  
of the chair. The meeting’s organizer shall inform all members of the means and method of electronically  
attending the meeting.

8.18. **Definitions. **The terms “notification”, “provided in writing”, and “written” when occurring  
throughout the Constitution and/or Bylaws shall include digital and electronic means as well as paper-  
based means of communication, as long as it is transmitted to the recipient and not merely posted on a  
website or bulletin board.

8.19 **Absence of Rule. **In the absence of any Rule governing a situation, Roberts Rules of Order,  
Newly Revised shall govern the procedure of any Group to which this Bylaw pertains.

### **9. AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS**

9.1 Any Bylaw may be amended by a majority of votes cast by delegates assembled in State  
Convention.

9.2 Any Section contained in Bylaw 5, State Central Committee, may be amended by a majority of
