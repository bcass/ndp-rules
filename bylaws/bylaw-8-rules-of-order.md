### **8. RULES OF ORDER**

8.1.**NDP Committees, Organizations and Affiliates.**The Rules of Order in this Bylaw pertain to  
Meetings of any Committee, Organization or Affiliate \(each referred to as “Group”\) of the Nebraska  
Democratic Party unless a Group adopts a written set of Rules of Order for its conduct of business in  
meetings. These Rules of Order do not pertain to the State Convention \(See Bylaw 1\). In this Bylaw  
members of any such Group are referred to as “members” even though the Group’s members may have a  
different title.

8.2.**Motions and Resolutions.**Members must secure recognition from the Chair in order to offer a  
motion, and the Chair may inquire for what purpose the member rises, and after hearing the motion, may  
decline recognition. After an order of business is adopted, no motions are admissible unless in order under  
the pending item of business or at that particular state of the proceedings. Motions may be stated orally or  
in writing. Resolutions must be submitted in writing.

**Explanation**: Unless otherwise indicated, all actions discussed in this Bylaw take a majority to pass.

8.3.**Amendments. A**mendments to any motion may be made orally or in writing and must be  
germane to the propositions to which offered. Amendments to Resolutions must be in writing and  
germane to the Resolution being offered. Majority and minority reports from committees are subject to  
amendment from the floor unless the previous question is operating.

8.4.**Debate.**Recognition for debate is within the discretion of the Chair, but members of Committees  
reporting a proposition under discussion are entitled to the floor and take precedence over others desiring  
to be heard. A member desiring to interrupt a speaker shall address the Chair and secure the consent of the  
speaker. Debate is not in order during roll call vote while a call is pending. Debate may be limited at the  
discretion of the Chair; however, a simple motion to extend the debate is in order.

8.5.**Committee Reports.**When Committees are recognized to report, the Chair of the Committee  
may read the report himself or have it read by the Secretary. When committee reports are submitted, the  
question of agreeing to the report is considered as pending. Minority reports from committees must be  
presented and read immediately following majority reports, and both are then open to debate and  
amendment, unless the previous question is ordered. When more than one minority report is submitted, all  
are presented before consideration on the majority report begins, and are taken up in the order presented.  
The question comes first on minority reports and then on majority report or minority report as amended.

8.6.**Division.**A division of the question, and a separate vote on each substantive proposition  
contained in a committee report or any pending question, may be requested by any member, and is in  
order even after the previous question is demanded.

8.7.**Points of Order.**Points of order against a proceeding are too late after debate has begun or other  
business has intervened. Debate on a question of order is within the discretion of the Chair. Points of  
Order arising during a roll call are decided peremptorily and are not subject to appeal.

8.8.**Previous Question.**The previous question when ordered precludes both debate and amendment.  
The normal motion is “I move the previous question.” However, saying, “I call the question” or “I call for  
the question” should be taken as moving the previous question. The motion requires a second, is not  
debatable and cannot be amended. It requires a two-thirds \(2/3\) majority to pass. If passed the effect is to  
end debate and move to vote on the question being considered.

**Explanation:**When a member says, "I move the previous question," such motion is then considered to be  
the pending question, and the motion which was pending when the previous question was moved is  
considered to be the previous question.

8.9.**Reconsidered.**When a motion is carried or lost, any member of the majority may move  
reconsideration at the same meeting of the Group. This motion takes precedence over all motions except  
motion to adjourn.

8.10.**Delay or end consideration of a Question.**

8.10.1**Table.**A motion to lay on the table is used to delay consideration of a motion or amendment. It  
is not debatable and may not be amended. Unless the motion to table specifies a time certain to resume  
consideration, a motion to remove it from the table must be made to continue such consideration. An  
amendment laid on the table carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was offered.

8.10.2.**Postpone.**A motion to postpone consideration is used when it is evident that more information is  
needed to enhance the debate of a question. A time certain to resume consideration should be included in  
such a motion. It is debatable and may be amended. A motion to postpone requires a simple majority to  
pass. An amendment postponed carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was offered.

8.10.3.**Postpone Indefinitely.**A motion to postpone indefinitely is used by a group to indicate that the  
group does not wish to take a position on the question. The motion is debatable but may not be amended.  
An amendment postponed indefinitely carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was  
offered.

8.11.**Recess.**A motion to recess is always in order, and not debatable.

8.12.**Motion to Adjourn.**A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn to meet at a designated time  
and/or date may be made at any time recognition is secured for that purpose, but is not in order during a  
roll call. A simple motion to adjourn is not debatable and may not be laid on the table. A motion to  
adjourn at a certain time is debatable and subject to amendment. A motion to adjourn to a day and/or time  
certain or to meet at another place is in order, is debatable and amendable. All motions to adjourn are  
decided by a majority vote.

8.13.**Decorum.**Members and guests are expected to be seated and to refrain from loud conversation  
during a meeting.

8.14.**Suspension of Rules.**A motion to suspend the Rules does not pertain to the Rules in this Bylaw  
but to any procedural rules adopted by a Group. The motion interrupts the regular order of business and is  
in order at any time except during roll call, but recognition to move suspension is within the jurisdiction  
of the Chair. The motion requires a two-thirds \(2/3\) majority. The motion to suspend the Rules may not  
be amended, reconsidered or laid on the table.

8.15.**Unanimous Consent.**Any action may be taken and any proceeding had by unanimous consent  
regardless of the Rules or pending order of business, but recognition of any motion to unanimously  
consent is within the discretion of the Chair and may not be granted except for routine matters and under  
exceptional circumstances.

8.16.**Who is Entitled to Speak.**A person who is not a member of a Group shall not be permitted to  
address the Group in any meeting unless such person is given permission to do so by the Chair or by  
unanimous consent of the members present.

8.17.**Electronic Meetings.**Unless specifically prohibited in governing documents, meetings may be  
convened or attended using electronic means such as teleconference or video conference, at the discretion  
of the chair. The meeting’s organizer shall inform all members of the means and method of electronically  
attending the meeting.

8.18.**Definitions.**The terms “notification”, “provided in writing”, and “written” when occurring  
throughout the Constitution and/or Bylaws shall include digital and electronic means as well as paper-  
based means of communication, as long as it is transmitted to the recipient and not merely posted on a  
website or bulletin board.

8.19**Absence of Rule.**In the absence of any Rule governing a situation, Roberts Rules of Order,  
Newly Revised shall govern the procedure of any Group to which this Bylaw pertains.
