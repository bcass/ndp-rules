### 1.**STATE CONVENTION**

#### 1.1.**General**

1.1.1.**Official Acts of Nebraska Democratic Party.**The determination of a Democratic Party State  
Convention conducted in accordance with the Official Rules for Democratic Conventions then in force  
shall be the official acts of the Democratic Party, and no other body, no matter how constituted, shall be  
authorized to represent the Nebraska Democratic Party, or in any political subdivision thereof, and its  
determination shall have no force or effect as official acts of the Nebraska Democratic Party or any  
political subdivision.

1.1.2.**Composition.**The Democratic State Convention is composed of accredited delegates \(and  
alternates\) elected every two \(2\) years by accredited delegates of County Conventions in accordance with  
the apportionment determined by the State Central Committee. The allocation shall be based upon a  
formula allocating a specified number of delegates among the counties based upon an equal weighting of  
the following factors in the counties against statewide totals: the vote for the Democratic candidate for  
Governor in the last General Election in which a Governor was elected; the vote for the Democratic  
candidate for President in the last General Election in which a President was elected; and the number of  
registered Democrats as of December 31st of the year preceding the election year. In the event that one or  
more factors cannot be reasonably determined, the State Central Committee may develop a comparable  
alternative factor to be used to allocate delegates. Final delegates totals allocated to each county may be  
adjusted to insure that within each county there is at least one delegate from each county and one delegate  
from each congressional district and legislative district within the county based upon the most recent  
district boundaries approved by the Legislature. Elected officers of the Nebraska Democratic Party shall  
also serve as delegates, without alternates, to State Convention.

a member of the Convention to preside temporarily in the Chair’s stead, but may not appoint one not a  
member of the Convention. No appeals from a decision of the Chair are in order on \(a\) recognition; or, \(b\)  
in response to dilatory parliamentary inquiry; or, \(c\) during roll call. The Chair shall not decide  
hypothetical questions or inquiries not directly raised by the proceedings. The Chair may direct the  
Sergeants-at-Arms to remove disorderly spectators

1.1.7.**Nomination and Election of Permanent Officers.**Permanent Officers shall be nominated by

action by the County Convention, may define terms and conditions under which the alternates shall act.

#### 1.2.**Quorums, Majorities, Percentages**

1.2.1.**Quorum.**A majority of the total number of delegates authorized by law to constitute the full  
membership of the State Convention or of a Congressional District Caucus/ Convention shall constitute a

1.2.1.1**Business When Quorum Present.**When a quorum is once established, a State Convention may  
thereafter transact any business which may properly come before it.

1.2.1.2**Business in Absence of Quorum.**In the event that no quorum is present when a State  
Convention is called to order, such convention may proceed to elect permanent officers and to hear

conducted by said convention.

1.2.1.3**Ascertainment of Quorum:**

**By Chair**. The Chair of any Convention or caucus may ascertain by his/her**v**iew whether or not a  
quorum is present.

**By Roll Call.**If the point of order is raised that no quorum is present, the ascertainment of a quorum

where said convention is being held may be counted in determining whether or not a quorum is present,  
and the Chair shall have the authority to appoint Sergeants-at-Arms to gather such persons into the  
convention hall before the count is completed**.**

1.2.1.4**Procedure in Event of Withdrawal of Members from Convention Hall After Quorum  
Established.**In the event that any delegates who were present in a State Convention at the time the Chair  
declared a quorum to be present shall absent themselves from the convention hall for any reason

present at all times and Bylaws 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 shall govern determination of any action taken by the  
delegates.

1.2.2.**What Constitutes a Majority.**A Majority is one \(1\) more than half; if half is a fraction, then the  
next whole number constitutes one \(1\) more than half. A majority of all votes cast on any motion shall be  
sufficient to pass such a motion unless otherwise provided in these Bylaws.

1.2.3.**Determination of Percentages.**When the Statutes or Bylaws require certain percentages of  
votes cast by a convention to determine any question, such percentage shall be computed on the basis of  
all of the votes cast upon the question under consideration.

#### **1.3. Committees**

1.3.1.**Standing Committees.**The two standing committees for each State Convention shall be as  
follows: \(a\) Committee on Credentials; \(b\) Committee to Recommend Nominations of Presidential and  
Vice Presidential Electors \(only during presidential election years\).

1.3.2.**Selection of Convention Committees.**Prior to the convening of each State Convention, the  
Chair of each standing committee above named shall be selected by the State Executive Committee with  
the approval of the State Central Committee. At the time and place to be designated by the State Chair  
during the State Central Committee meeting scheduled at least sixty \(60\) days prior to the Convention, the  
members of the State Central Committee shall hold caucuses by Congressional District to elect temporary  
members of the following committees. In each such Congressional District caucus, the members of the  
State Central Committee shall elect two \(2\) members to serve on the Committee on Credentials, and two

State Convention or of the State Central Committee shall be considered by the State Convention if signed  
by one-third of the members of the Standing Committee and offered as a substitute for the majority report.

#### **1.4 Rules of Order**

1.4.1.**Motion to Adjourn.**A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn to meet at a designated time  
may be made at any time recognition is secured for that purpose, but is not in order during a roll call. A  
simple motion to adjourn is not debatable and may not be laid on the table, but a motion to adjourn at a  
certain time is debatable and subject to amendment. A motion to adjourn to a day certain to meet at  
another place is in order and may be decided by a majority vote.

1.4.2.**Amendments.**Amendments to any motion may be made orally, but before consideration thereof  
must be submitted in writing and must be germane to the propositions to which offered. Agreement to a  
motion to lay amendment on the table carries with it the proposition to which it is offered. Majority and  
minority reports from committees are subject to amendment from the floor unless the previous question is  
operating.

1.4.3.**Roll Call.**The roll call shall be called by Counties, and Districts within Counties, and the Chair  
of the County or District delegation shall take the poll and announce the vote.

1.4.4.**Challenges**

1.4.4.1**From within Delegation.**On roll call by Counties and Districts within Counties, a delegation  
shall be polled on challenge by any member of the delegation. Demand for poll of delegation or challenge  
of accuracy of count must be made when vote is reported and comes too late after the next County, or  
District within a County, is called. Such demand may not be made by anyone not a member of the  
delegation and no delegate may request a poll of any other delegation than his/her own. The only method  
by which a poll of a delegation may be had is by challenging the accuracy of the count or report, but such  
challenge is in order on any vote regardless of the character. The poll of a delegation must include the  
entire delegation. A demand for a poll of a delegation may be withdrawn any time before the poll starts.  
The Chair of the Convention may defer a poll until the conclusion of a roll call. When a delegation is  
polled, the delegates in responding to their names are restricted to the bare announcement of their vote  
and explanations or comments of any character are out of order.

1.4.4.2**From Floor.**Upon demand from the floor by any delegate, the Chair of the Convention shall call  
a roll of a delegation to determine the number of eligible delegates thereof present.

1.4.5.**Committee Reports.**When Committees are recognized to report, the Chair of the Committee  
may read the report himself or have it read by the reading clerk of the Convention. At the conclusion of  
the reading of the report, the Chair has fifteen \(15\) minutes in which he may \(1\) speak to the report, \(2\)  
yield time to others to speak, or \(3\) move the previous question. When committee reports are submitted,  
the question of agreeing to the report is considered as pending. Minority reports from committees must be  
presented and read immediately following majority reports, and both are then open to debate and  
amendment, unless the previous question is ordered. When more than one minority report is submitted, all  
are presented before consideration on the majority report begins, and are taken up in the order presented.  
The question comes first on minority reports and then on majority report or minority report as amended.

1.4.6.**Debate.**Recognition for debate is within the discretion of the Chair, but members of Committees  
reporting a proposition under discussion are entitled to the floor and take precedence over others desiring  
to be heard. A delegate desiring to interrupt a speaker shall address the Chair and secure the consent of  
the speaker. The Chair of a committee making the report may have fifteen \(15\) minutes to speak. All  
other debate shall be limited to five \(5\) minutes to each speaker. No delegate shall speak twice to the  
same question unless permission is granted by general consent, and then only if all others who wish to  
speak have been heard.

1.4.7.**Decorum.**Delegates and guests are expected to be seated and to refrain from loud conversation  
during session of the Convention. Aisles and platforms must be kept clear.

1.4.8.**Delegates.**A delegate announcing that he/she will not abide by the decision of the Convention is  
not entitled to participate in its deliberations. Delegates failing to observe Rules of the Convention are  
subject to expulsion by two- thirds \(2/3\) vote.

1.4.9.**Division.**A division of the question, and a separate vote on each substantive proposition  
contained in a committee report or any pending question, may be requested by any delegate, and is in  
order even after the previous question is demanded.

1.4.10.**Motions and Resolutions.**Delegates must secure recognition from the Chair in order to offer a  
motion, and the Chair may inquire for what purpose the delegate rises, and after hearing the motion, may  
decline recognition. After an order of business is adopted, no motions are admissible unless in order under  
the pending item of business or at that particular state of the proceedings.

1.4.11.**Points of Order.**Points of order against a proceeding are too late after debate has begun or other  
business has intervened. Debate on a question of order is within the discretion of the Chair. Points of  
Order arising during a roll call are decided peremptorily and are not subject to appeal.

1.4.12.**Previous Question.**The previous question when ordered precludes both debate and amendment.  
A Committeeperson presenting a report may move the previous question, but if ordered before any debate  
is had on the question, twenty \(20\) minutes of debate is allowed, ten \(10\) minutes for each side.

**Explanation:**When a member says, "I move the previous question," such motion is then considered to be  
the pending question, and the motion which was pending when the previous question was moved is  
considered to be the previous question.

1.4.13.**Recess.**A motion to recess is always in order, and not debatable.

1.4.14.**Reconsidered.**When a motion is carried or lost, any member of the majority may move  
reconsideration at the same session of the convention. This motion takes precedence over all motions  
except motion to adjourn.

1.4.15.**Suspension of Rules.**Motion to suspend the Rules interrupts the regular order of business and is  
in order at any time except during roll call, but recognition to move suspension is within the jurisdiction  
of the Chair and the motion requires a two-thirds \(2/3\) majority. The motion to suspend the Rules may not  
be amended, reconsidered or laid on the table.

1.4.16.**Table.**A motion to lay on the table is used to delay consideration of a motion or amendment. It  
is not debatable and may not be amended. Unless the motion to table specifies a time certain to resume  
consideration, a motion to remove it from the table must be made to continue such consideration. An  
amendment laid on the table carries with it the proposition to which the amendment was offered.

**Explanation:**A motion to lay on the table is out of order after a pending motion \(except an amendment\)  
which has been made and debated, is about to be put on a vote.

1.4.17.**Unanimous Consent.**Any action may be taken and any proceeding had by unanimous consent  
regardless of the Rules or pending order of business, but recognition of any motion to unanimously  
consent is within the discretion of the Chair and may not be granted except for routine matters and under  
exceptional circumstances.

1.4.18.**Who is Entitled to Speak.**No person who is not a delegate or an alternate who is taking the  
place of a delegate, shall be permitted to address the convention unless such person has been previously  
requested to do so by the Democratic State Central Committee or by a three-fourths \(3/4\) vote of the  
Convention. Unless otherwise fixed by the State Central Committee, all such speeches shall be limited to  
three \(3\) minutes.

1.4.19.**Definitions.**The terms “notification”, “provided in writing”, and “written” when occurring  
throughout the Constitution and/or Bylaws shall include digital and electronic means as well as paper-  
based means of communication, as long as it is transmitted to the recipient and not merely posted on a  
website or bulletin board.

1.4.20**Absence of Rule.**In the absence of any rule governing a situation, Roberts Rules of Order shall  
govern the procedure of the Convention.

#### **1.5. Voting**.

1.5.1.**Qualifications to Vote.**No person shall be permitted to vote in any State Convention unless  
he/she has been duly elected and certified as a delegate; or, in the absence of such elected delegate, unless  
he/she has been elected as an alternate in the manner set forth in Article IV, Section 6.

1.5.2.**Each Delegate One Vote.**All delegates who are found to be duly qualified shall be entitled to  
one vote on any question coming before the State Convention.

1.5.3.**Proxy or Unit Rule.**No delegate or alternate shall be permitted to vote by proxy and no  
delegations shall apply to the Unit Rule.

1.5.4.**Method of Voting.**

1.5.4.1**Roll Call: Announced by Delegation Chair.**On roll call of the Counties and Legislative  
Districts within Counties, the vote of the County or Legislative District shall be announced by the Chair  
of the County or Legislative District delegation, or in his/her absence, by the Vice Chair. Delegations not  
prepared to announce their vote may be passed and called at the end of roll call.

1.5.4.2**Place of Casting Vote.**In order to vote, a delegate must sit with his/her delegation and may not  
vote from another part of the hall and may not deputize another to cast his/her vote for him/her.

1.5.4.3**Change of Vote or Abstention.**A delegate may decline to vote or may change his/her vote at  
any time prior to the announcement of the final result. A delegate proposing to change his/her vote must  
rise in his/her place and personally request the change.

1.5.4.4**Demand for Roll Call.**A roll call for yeas and nays must be ordered on demand of one-fourth  
\(1/4\) of the delegates present.
